# ThumbnailCreator

This is a utility I'm creating/using for the thumbnails of my YouTube videos. It's nothing much, but makes it easier on me.

## Dependencies:

This project uses [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) for the graphics

## Credits:

- Graphics library: [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp)
